                <h2>Grama Sachivalayam</h2>
                <p>Grama Sachivalayam (also known as Village Secretariats) are local government facilities set up in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh to decentralize the administration by making services and welfare services of all government departments available at one place. Andhra Pradesh was the first Indian state to launch such a program. Government of Andhra Pradesh appointed Village Secretariat Staff on a regular basis and Volunteers on an outsourcing basis to deliver services. It was launched on Gandhi Jayanti since the scheme was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's concept of Grama Swarajya that promotes villages becoming self-sufficient, autonomous entities.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Establishment of village secretariats was one of the promises made by Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy during his Praja Sankalpa Yatra. The program was first launched after recruitment for positions was opened in July. The written exam was conducted between 1 September 2019 to 8 September 2019, and the result was declared on 19 September 2019 where a total of 1,98,164 candidates were qualified. Each volunteer looks over 50 households.</p>
                <p>As of October 2021, 15,004 village and ward secretariats had been established with 1,26,649 secretariat staff on regular basis and volunteers.</p>
            <h2 >EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   </h2>
            <p>We conducted a community service project in the rural villages of Vinukonda, Andhra Pradesh, focusing on the vital Sachivalayam services. These local government offices play a crucial role in delivering essential services and welfare schemes to the villagers. Our primary goal was to increase awareness and utilization of these services</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                As part of our sachivalayam project, I visited the local sachivalayam office to understand the range of services provided and their impact on the community, particularly the uneducated population. During the visit, I interacted with the staff and observed how they assist citizens with various needs.

The sachivalayam offers a plethora of services aimed at improving the lives of uneducated people, including access to healthcare, education, social welfare, and agricultural support. I noted that the staff were patient and used simple language to explain complex processes, making the information accessible to everyone.

One of the key services is the facilitation of healthcare programs, where uneducated individuals are guided on how to avail of medical services and participate in health awareness campaigns. The sachivalayam also plays a critical role in enrolling children in schools, providing scholarships, and promoting adult literacy programs.

Social welfare schemes such as pensions for the elderly and financial aid for marginalized communities are made easily accessible through the sachivalayam. The staff assists uneducated citizens in filling out necessary forms and understanding eligibility criteria.

Agricultural support services include training on modern farming techniques and subsidies for seeds and fertilizers. The sachivalayam ensures that even those with limited education can improve their farming practices and livelihoods.

Overall, the sachivalayam acts as a bridge between the government and the uneducated population, ensuring that they are not left behind in accessing essential services.
